iSolver Pro
Author: Parker Caputo

iSolver Pro was developed with the intention of making a comprehensive graphing calculator available to users on their smartphone. 
iSolver Pro is divided into two functional sections: a graphing calculator, and equation solvers. 
The graphing calculator has functionality almost mirroring that of a handheld Texas Instruments 84ti model calculator. 
The solvers, however, build upon the graphing utility’s abilities. 
The solvers allow users to select predetermined equations and receive an output answering those equations. 
If applicable, the answer is graphed using the application’s graphing utility.
