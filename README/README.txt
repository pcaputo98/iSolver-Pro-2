iSolver Pro
Author: Parker Caputo

Overview:
iSolver Pro was developed with the intention of making a comprehensive graphing calculator available to users on their smartphone. 
iSolver Pro is divided into two functional sections: a graphing calculator, and equation solvers. 
The graphing calculator has functionality almost mirroring that of a handheld Texas Instruments 84ti model calculator.
The solvers, however, build upon the graphing utility’s abilities. 
The solvers allow users to select predetermined equations and receive an output answering those equations. 
If applicable, the answer is graphed using the application’s graphing utility.

Objective:
The objective of iSolver Pro is geared to two populations. First, it offers an affordable alternative to a traditional handheld calculator that some students may not be able to otherwise afford to complete their assignments. The second population are students who have graphing calculators but prefer a portable alternative.

LEGACY: 
The iSolver series achieved approximately 15,000+ downloads globally. 
Because I no longer maintain the application, I have uploaded the code to a public repository in the hopes that someone may benefit from it. 
Of particular interest may be the objects supporting the graphing utility. 
While the solvers rely on simple regular expressions for parsing, the graphing calculator utilizes DParser code based on the Tomita algorithm.
